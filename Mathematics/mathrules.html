<li>The test is divided into three sections: Multi-choice, Subjective and Essay.</li>
<li>Each section is different from the others in the format of questions, format of answers and time allocation. </li>
<li>The time allocated to the Multi-choice section is thirty(30) minutes.  You are required to answer all questions in this section. There are thirty(30) questions in total. You are strictly allowed to select only one answer of the four options available per question. All questions here carry equal mark  </li>
<li>The time allocated to the Subjective section is thirty(30) minutes. You are required to answer all questions in this section. There are thirty(30) questions in total. You will be required to type in your answer. All questions carry different marks and this depends on how many answers you are asked to provide. Note that the answer you input must be strictly a number. Decimal, fractions and integers are allowed. Degree symbols, greek alphabets or currency signs are not allowed. Figures that are recurring should be rounded up to three significant figures, unless you are told otherwise </li>
<li>The time allocated to the Essay section is one(1) hour. You are required to answer all six questions in Compulsory Module and four out of six questions in Optional Module. There will be textboxes provided for inputting your final answer. Your final answer here will be exactly what it is on the paper. This means it may contain degree signs, math symbols, currency symbols etc. Note that the paper you will be working on will be divided into articles that will bear a question number. You must strictly show all workings in these articles and your final answer must be clearly distinguished from the other workings by circling it or underlining it. The workings you show will affect your total score so operate as directed. All questions in the Compulsory Module carry equal marks. All questions in the Optional Module carry different marks. </li>
