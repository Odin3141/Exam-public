9. It is known that the weight, W, of a body on a flat surface is the product of it's mass, m, and the acceleration due to gravity, g. What is the value of W if the flat surface now makes an angle,&theta; , with the horizontal ground?
<script>
localStorage.setItem("PHY9A", "W = mgtan&theta;")
localStorage.setItem("PHY9B", "W = mg")
localStorage.setItem("PHY9C", "W = mgsin&theta;")
localStorage.setItem("PHY9D", "None")
</script>
